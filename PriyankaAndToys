// Priyanka works for an international toy company that ships by container. Her task is to the determine the lowest cost way to combine her orders for shipping.
// The requirement is that all items in a container are within 4 units of weight. (e.g 1-5, 15-19, 23-27 etc.)
// this function takes in a list of weights (w).
// It returns the number of containers needed to ship the toys.

    w.sort((a, b) => a - b);
